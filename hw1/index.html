                    <p>Hi! I'm in my last couple of courses for my Masters in CS. I came into the degree from an art background. I have very general experience with HTML and CSS. Nothing too advanced, but nothing too rudimentary. I have a bit less experience in JS, but I do have okay experience in React. I learned React on the fly for an internship once, so I don't know the logic or some core concepts too well like hooks. I just started learning Bootstrap, and my experience with Node is okay thanks to learning React at my last internship. With learning Web Apps, I'm interested in learning more of how front end works with back end as well as more on the logic and core concepts of React. That way, I have better foundation knowledge on React. This class would be beneficial to me in pursuit for further understanding of general web development, so for communication purposes, I prefer Discord.</p>
